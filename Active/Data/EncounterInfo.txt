While traveling through a smaller forest road trouble soon|||||comes your way. A large tree is laying over the only clear|||||path which would make it exceedingly difficult to pass. When|||||pondering on why it would be there in the first place three bandit|||||thugs lash out from the bushes set their blades at your direction.|||||Oi!

Not only was the weather getting worse by the minute but while|||||trying to cross a road filled with rocks and wet mud your|||||wagon slips and manages to crack on one of the sharper rocks|||||below. It is rendered beyond repair by your own hands but should|||||be fixable with the right tools and expertise.
